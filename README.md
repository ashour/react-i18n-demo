# μvees - a React i18n Demo

This demo goes along with a [PhraseApp blog article about React i18n](https://phraseapp.com/blog/posts/react-i18n-app/).

There are two apps included with this demo. One is an admin and the other is a front-facing app.

## Admin Installation
- Clone the repo
- `cd {repo_root}/admin`
- `npm install` (or `yarn`)
- `npm run start` (or `yarn start`)

## Front Installation
- Clone the repo
- `cd {repo_root}/front`
- `npm install` (or `yarn`)
- `npm run start` (or `yarn start`)


This two apps were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
